## Notes
1. Even if there is only one input, it needs to somehow be validated, even if it's done through HTML.
2. Ideally, we would display an error message for each input individually.
3. Computed properties are reactive.
4. re-inventing the wheel.
5. The $dirty property represents if a model has been touched.
